## Process

1. **User interacts with the interface and triggers an event** (like clicking a button).
2. **Controller handles the incoming requests** (via action methods).
3. **Controller decides the response** (selecting a view or calling the model to prepare data).
4. **Model interacts with the database** if necessary and processes the business logic.
5. **View renders the final interface** to display, using the data provided by the model.

This separation allows the application to be scaled easily and also makes it more maintainable.
