# What is MVC?

## Overview

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It is an architectural pattern used for developing web applications. The MVC pattern is divided into three interconnected parts, which helps separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.

## Components

- **Model**: The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.
- **View**: Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram, or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible.
- **Controller**: Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.

## Benefits

- **Simplicity**: MVC segregates the application into three main components, making it easier to manage.
- **Support for asynchronous technique**: MVC supports asynchronous technique, which helps developers to develop an application that loads very fast.
- **Modification does not affect the entire model**: Changes in the model will not affect the entire architecture.
- **SEO Friendly**: MVC platform supports the development of SEO friendly web pages or web applications.
